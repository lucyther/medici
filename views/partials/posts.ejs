        <h4 class="text-center">May 30, 2020</h4>
          <br>
          <img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F998e2c9b-ed1e-4822-af0c-0136b393913e%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=628a1f71-6424-4b8e-9c91-0bbd04e5af4f&width=3730&cache=v2" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="80%" alt="" style="margin: 2em">
          <p>Medici is focused on helping its users store and earn interest in stable cryptocurrencies. This means we specialize in tokens pegged to fiat currencies, and select those with a proven track record of a 1:1 token-to-fiat ratio.</p>
          <p>We started with supporting DAI, and are in the process of adding <strong>USD Coin</strong> and <strong>Tether</strong>.</p>
  
          <h4>USD Coin</h4>
            <p>Managed by Circle and Coinbase, two of the most reputable organizations in the cryptocurrency space, the USDC Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. It has a 1:1 representation against the US Dollar on the Ethereum blockchain. USDC tokens can be converted to USD at any time. The issuing and redeeming of USDC tokens is tracked by an ERC-20 contract. </p>
            <p>The stability mechanism of the USD Coin is that every USDC token is backed with a US dollar.</p>
            <p>USDC can be acquired using a debit card via Wyre or Moonpay, and sent to the user's Medici wallet. From there, the user decides how much USDC they want to supply for earning interest.</p>
        
            <h4>Tether</h4>
            <p>Tether also aims to have a 1:1 peg against the US Dollar. It is relatively more controversial than its competitors such as DAI and USDC.</p>
            <p>Tethers exist on the Bitcoin blockchain, and utilizes "proof of reserves" to ascertain its stability against traditional currency. Tether is currently publishing the value of their reserves daily, and claims that the value of their reserves match or exceed the value of all Tethers in circulation.</p>

            <h4>Earning APY</h4>
            <p>The current Compound APY earned by supplying the above tokens:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="col">Token</th>
                    <th scope="col">APY</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>DAI</td>
                    <td>0.73%</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>USDC</td>
                    <td>2.08%</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>USDT</td>
                    <td>1.74%</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>

        <h3 class="font-weight-light blog-post-title">Medici's Built-in Wallet</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center">May 30, 2020</h4>
          <br>
          <img src="/assets/portis-banner.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="80%" alt="" style="margin: 2em">

          <p>Medici uses <a href="/https://www.portis.io/" class="gold-text">Portis</a>, a non-custodial wallet that allows users to interact with the blockchain without having to install anything. The user's private keys are encrypted and stored client-side and can be accessed from any device.</p>

          <p>Users can log in with a username/password and sign transaction in the browser. This allows for a much smoother experience when it comes to onboarding, checking crypto funds, as well as signing transactions. It makes decentralized apps less intimidating to the mainstream user.</p>

          <p>To use Portis, Medici installs the SDK into its web app. If a user is on Medici for the first time, they can use the Portis widget to create a new account. As soon as a new account is created, a wallet is also generated. To access their wallet on Medici (or wallet.portis.com), all they have to do is log in with their username and password.</p>

          <h4>Ability to Relay Gas Fees & Automatically Confirm Tarnsactions</h4>
          <p>Gas fees are required for Ethereum transactions, as a form of incentives for miners to keep the network running. However, this can also add friction to the user experience. We can think of it like paying for AWS fees when interacting with a "mainstream" app. It is <strong>a)</strong> a technical detail that the user might find counterintuitive and <strong>b)</strong> an additional step in the user experience. Portis offers the ability for apps to pay for these small fees under the hood. </p>

          <p>With Portis, users will also be able to confirm transactions automatically by toggling the "Trust this app" option.</p>

          <p>These features are not yet implemented, but we're excited about the ability for more abstraction in favor of the user!</p>

    <h2 class="font-weight-lighter text-center"><span class="underline--magical-yellow-thin">About Medici</span></h2>

    <h3 class="font-weight-light">Earn interest on savings converted to crypto assets.</h3>
    <h4 class="font-weight-lighter">Open to anyone in the world. Get started in minutes.</h4>

    <br>
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">What is Medici?</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-lighter">
        We are building Medici to address a few issues in today's turbulent economy and the blockchain space:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter"><b>Hedge currency depreciation risk:</b>Â Make it easy for anyone in the world to hold "stable" assets (digital gold, digital dollar)</li>
        <br>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter"><b>Lower barriers to entry for investing:</b>Â Allow anyone to invest in a range of interest-earning assets, without the need of setting up a bank or ETRADE account</li>
        <br>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter"><b>Poor UX in blockchain apps:</b> Easy onboarding without needing an existing crypto wallet, browser extensions, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-lighter">Medici values accessibility for international usersâ€”often, those who are the most in need for decentralized finance.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-lighter">To get started, Medici allows anyone to fund a crypto wallet with their debit card. The funds are then converted into a digital asset such as a stablecoin (DAI, USDC) and deposited into Compound.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-lighter">Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built on Ethereum, that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets. When you supply an asset to Compound, that asset can start earning interest right away.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-lighter">In V1, users will be able to monitor their earnings on the Medici UI and instantly deposit or redeem their assets (as Ethereum or DAI).</p>

    <img src="/assets/wallet-ui.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="40%" style="padding: 1em">

    <br>
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">Why blockchain?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">You only need an internet connection to start investing. This drastically lowers the barriers to entry. Those of us who live in the United States take this for grantedâ€”we have our Robinhood and Wealthfront accounts, 401k, and we earn a salary in the world's favorite currency. We laugh at how cheap everything is when we take our USD and go to Thailand, Greece, Japan. But most people outside the US (especially in the developing world) have much fewer options.</li>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">It is an ingenious method to hedge currency depreciation: Usually, you can't hold USD if you live and have an account in Brazil or Vietnam. But if your domestic currency is one of those being hammered by COVID-19, you might be going through the anxiety of watching the value of your earnings plummet. Today's economy is a global one, so you're impacted even if you don't leave your home country (for example, coffee might become more expensive if your country relies on importing this commodity).</li>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">Generate earnings, but not just in a specific currency: Even if you use a Mexican version of Robinhood, odds are your investments are still in Peso. So if you've lost trust in your local currency, you have very few options. The blockchain allows you to hold a variety of assets: USD stablecoins, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class="font-weight-light">Why now?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">In 2020, DeFi is taking the blockchain space by storm. One of its most promising protocols, Compound (funded by Bain, a16z, Coinbase) is now allowing people to earn interest on Tetherâ€”which offers digital versions of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and offshore Chinese yuan. Many of Compound's developer docs were written in the past month!</li>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">We are seeing a wave of new tools and libraries for developers to build on top of, which can facilitate onboarding the "mainstream" user.</li>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">a16z announced crypto fund II this past week (May 2020), a $500M fund to accelerate next-generation payments, decentralized finance, web3, and more.</li>
        <li class="py-2 font-weight-lighter">COVID-19 has caused fear in the markets, hence the spike in gold and anxiety around currency depreciation.</li>
    </ol>
